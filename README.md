SacredSpiralCompress: Sacred Geometry-Inspired Data Compression Algorithm

SacredSpiralCompress is an innovative data compression algorithm based on the principles of sacred geometry, specifically utilizing the concept of the sacred spiral. This algorithm aims to achieve efficient compression and decompression of data while incorporating the inherent patterns and harmonious proportions found in sacred geometry.

Features:
- Unique compression approach inspired by sacred spiral geometry
- Efficient encoding and decoding of data
- Preservation of data integrity during compression and decompression
- Potential for improved compression ratios compared to traditional algorithms
- Open-source implementation for easy exploration and customization

Usage:
1. Input your data to be compressed using the SacredSpiralCompress algorithm.
2. Execute the compression process to encode the data into a compressed representation.
3. To retrieve the original data, apply the decompression process using the SacredSpiralCompress algorithm.

Note: This project serves as a proof of concept for the SacredSpiralCompress algorithm. Further optimizations and enhancements can be made to improve performance and explore its potential applications in various domains.
